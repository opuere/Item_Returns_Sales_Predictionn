The Excellent Store Challenge Project

1) Problem Statement
The CEO of the company, Chief A. A. Babatunji, plans to expand the chain of stores to more Nigerian cities in 2025. However, as the COVID19 restrictions have affected the retail business, he sees the need to better understand which products return higher profits at specific stores so as to inform the expansion plan.

Business Goal : Using this model, as the new Retail Data Analyst to build a predictive model and find out the profit returns on each product at a particular store so as to inform the expansion plan.

2) Hypothesis Generation
There are four (04) hypothesis that we would want to test after the EDA:

On basis of item:
Item visibility in store: The location of product in a store will impact sales. Ones which are right at entrance will catch the eye of customer first rather than the ones in back.
Product Frequency: More frequent products will have high Sales.
On basis of store:

City type: Stores located in urban cities should have higher sales because of the higher income levels of people there.
Store capacity: Stores which are very big in size should have higher sales as they act like one-stop-shops and people would prefer getting everything from one place.
